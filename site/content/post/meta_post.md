I've gone through several iterations of my website within the last months.

F﻿rom a whacky interactive THREE.js version that I rather quickly got bored with.

A﻿ simplified version that just gives you a vague impression of the games I worked on and the hobbies I have.

**T﻿o now this version!**\
W﻿hich is more like my simplified version but now with blogging capabilities so I can give you a glimpse into what I like to do.

S﻿o hopefully overtime I will fill this up with more posts of projects I work on and things I like to share!
