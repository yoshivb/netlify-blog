Queer Art Fest was a wonderful weekend full of Art Exhibits, Tattooing, Performances, Music, and much much more.

F﻿or this weekend I worked at the entrance, welcoming people, showing them the way, providing information and sorting out wrist bands.\
I﻿t was a crazy hectic experience weekend, tons of people attended the fest and after working I got to enjoy it a bit myself as well.
